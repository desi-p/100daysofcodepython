# 100daysofcodepython

Hi, I am participating in the #100DaysofCode Challenge by completing a course on Udemy. I'll be pushing code everyday through the challenge! I'll be tracking the challenge on this ReadMe but also working on other projects in the next 100 days.

Day 1 - Band Name Generator 
-easy review of inputs and print statements

Day 2 - Tip Calculator
-using math (oh my) to determine the amount each member of a party needs to pay after their meal (I hope everyone actually tips more than 15%)
